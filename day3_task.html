        Emmet Live:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Emmet Live in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) refers to the ability to use Emmet for real-time coding enhancements, particularly when working with HTML and CSS. Emmet is a built-in feature in VS Code that allows you to write code faster by expanding abbreviations into full-fledged HTML or CSS structures.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Abbreviation Expansion:</b> Quickly write tags like div.container or ul>li*3 and expand them into full HTML structures.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Live Updates:</b> Combine Emmet with extensions like Live Server or Live Preview to see changes immediately as you code.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>CSS Shortcuts:</b> Write CSS properties using abbreviations, such as m10 for margin: 10px;.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Customizable:</b> Configure Emmet settings to match your coding style and needs.

            <td>
                used to navigate up one level in the HTML structure and add a sibling element. It’s especially useful when you need to move out of nested structures and continue building elements.

            <td>+</td>
